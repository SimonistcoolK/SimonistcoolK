## About me
I'm a student from Austria who likes to make the world a little better through small, useful projects. I keep things casual and approachable — I sometimes build HTML sites, write Python scripts, and dabble in Batch when needed.

## What I build
- Lightweight HTML sites and simple tooling
- Small Python utilities (e.g., webhook transmitters, bots, automation)
- Quick Batch scripts for Windows tasks

## Currently
Working on personal projects and learning new things. Open to small collaborations — sometimes I can help for free.

## Skills
- HTML
- Python
- Batch

## Featured project
- [Python-Webhook-transmitter](https://github.com/SimonistcoolK/Python-Webhook-transmitter) — a small Python project for transmitting/forwarding webhooks (see the repo for usage and examples).
